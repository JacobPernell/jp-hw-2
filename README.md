Game API app.

Using the API from [IGDB](https://api.igdb.com/), create an app with 2 pages.  One page should show popular games, and the other should show top rated.

The following required functionality is completed:
* User can view a list of popular games.  Images for the games must be loaded as well.
* User can view game details by clicking on a image/description/title.
* Don't use external JS libraries
* Use JS and CSS files rather than having your JS and CSS in script/style tags.
* You can use bootstrap, skeleton, or bulma as a CSS boilerplate if you want to.

Make it look good.
